        <p>The following proxy can be used to generate a list of all glossary entries in your project. Optional Tasks: You can select whether alphabetized headings should be automatically included at the top of each glossary section in the output. You can also select a style to affect the look of the entire glossary. To do either of these, right-click on the proxy below and select <b>Edit Glossary Proxy</b>. Then choose the appropriate option and/or style. If you need help, press <b>F1</b> when the dialog is open. When you are ready, you can delete this paragraph or replace it with your own text. <b>Note:</b> If you cannot see the proxy below, make sure your markers are turned on.  To do this, in the local toolbar click the down arrow next to the <b>Show Tags</b> button and select <b>Show Markers</b>.</p>
